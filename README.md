starting to think about how we introduce our app:

Our application is made specifically to help users learn a new language. The applicationâ€™s learning strategy features flashcards, a method known to be successful for three main reasons: engagement of active recall,  utilization of metacognitive facilities, and encouragement of confidence based recall. (https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2011/04/reasons-why-flashcards-are-so-effective/ )

The user first engages with the card in their chosen written phrases. The user then changes their primary language into a set of icons; the icons are now the cue for repetitive recall. By assigning visual cues separable by word, the application promotes the user to use visuals as a cue in their repetitive recall.
